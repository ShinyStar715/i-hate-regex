This expression can be used to find or validate a UUID. UUIDs are often used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. A UUID is a 128-bit number represented, textually, in 16 octets as 32 hexadecimal (base-16) digits. These 32 digits are displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12, for a total of 36 characters. You may edit the regex to your liking for removing hyphens.
